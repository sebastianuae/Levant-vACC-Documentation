## Introduction

### Purpose

This S1 Training Syllabus defines the standards, requirements, and procedures for S1 students to know as per GCAP requirements. It ensures realistic, safe, and consistent ATS delivery across all positions and sessions within Levant vACC.

### Scope

This syllabus outlines the structure and learning pathway for students pursuing the S1 rating within the Levant vACC.

Students will achieve the course objectives through a combination of independent study and guided practical training. Core learning materials are provided via the Moodle platform and Levant vACC Documentation.

In addition to self-study, students will receive one-on-one practical instruction from mentors and instructors. Active participation and engagement are encouraged throughout your training.

Students are also encouraged to ask questions and seek support from other members of the community, or through their training thread.

### Applicability

This document must be read in conjunction with the:

- VATSIM Global Controller Administration Policy (GCAP)
- VATSIM Air Traffic Control Frequency and Information Management Policy
- Levant vACC ATC Training Policy

!!! warning
    All material in this policy is intended for simulation use only. It must not be applied to real-world aviation operations. Levant vACC and its staff are not responsible for any misuse of this policy outside the VATSIM environment.

### Grading Criteria

Controllers will be graded during each session with a mentor or instructor. These evaluations are designed using Competency-Based Training and Assessment (CBTA) principles to ensure that controllers are progressing in both skills and knowledge. These results will be delivered to the student via a scoresheet tailored for the requirements for the VATSIM network.

### Required Reading

Students shall read the following documentation in preparation for the practical training phase.

#### Areas of Responsibility

- Describe in detail the areas of responsibility for:
    - Ground Movement Planner (GMP)
    - Ground Movement Control (GMC)
    - Air Control (AIR)

- Provide a basic description of the areas of responsibility for:
    - Finals Director (FIN), Approach (APP)
    - Enroute Radar (ACC)

#### Controller Software

- Update the FIR-specific sector file for each AIRAC cycle via AeroNav.
- Install and configure one of the supported audio clients.
- Connect to both the VATSIM network and the Sweatbox training server.
- Accurately record relevant information in the departure and arrival list datablocks.

#### Coordination

- Explain the purpose of coordination in air traffic control operations.
- Coordinate effectively with relevant controllers to support the roles of Ground Movement Planner (GMP) and Ground Movement Control (GMC), including but not limited to:
    - Issuing clearances
    - Managing flow restrictions (e.g. MDIs, CTOTs, EOBTs)
    - Handling runway changes
- Perform a proper handover to, and take-over from, another controller.

#### Coding System

- Identify the difference between an ICAO and IATA code.

#### Flight Planning

- Explain the purpose of a flight plan and how pilots file them.
- Amend flight plans using both EuroScope and the TopSky Flight Plan dialog.
- Use [Simbrief](https://www.simbrief.com/home/) or the VFPC function to identify and correct invalid routings up to the FIR boundary.
- Assign appropriate initial altitudes and levels based on departure instructions (e.g. clearance from APP/ACC or as per a SID).
- Verify and correct requested flight levels (RFLs) in accordance with the semi-circular rule.
- Identify and correct RFLs that exceed bordering FIR cruise level restrictions.

#### Flow Management

- Explain the purpose of a Calculated Take-Off Time (CTOT).
- Describe how a CTOT is applied on VATSIM.
- Explain the purpose of a Minimum Departure Interval (MDI).
- Sequence aircraft on the ground to minimize departure delays.
- Understand the benefits of implementing flow control restrictions at aerodromes, including:
    - Reducing congestion on taxiways and at holding points
    - Minimizing the time aircraft spend with engines running and burning fuel
    - Considering the broader implications for en-route airspace

#### Low Visibility Procedures (LVP)

- Explain the purpose of Low Visibility Procedures (LVPs) and the minima for their enforcement at their training aerodrome.
- Describe and practically demonstrate an understanding of the impact of LVPs on aerodrome operations.
- Modify an ATIS broadcast to indicate that LVPs are in force.
