## Introduction

### Purpose

This S2 Training Syllabus defines the standards, requirements, and procedures for S2 students to know as per GCAP requirements. It ensures realistic, safe, and consistent ATS delivery across all positions and sessions within Levant vACC.

### Scope

This syllabus outlines the structure and learning pathway for students pursuing the S2 rating within the Levant vACC.

Students will achieve the course objectives through a combination of independent study and guided practical training. Core learning materials are provided via the Moodle platform and Levant vACC Documentation.

In addition to self-study, students will receive one-on-one practical instruction from mentors and instructors. Active participation and engagement are encouraged throughout your training.

Students are also encouraged to ask questions and seek support from other members of the community, or through their training thread.

### Applicability

This document must be read in conjunction with the:

- VATSIM Global Controller Administration Policy (GCAP)
- VATSIM Air Traffic Control Frequency and Information Management Policy
- Levant vACC ATC Training Policy

!!! warning
    All material in this policy is intended for simulation use only. It must not be applied to real-world aviation operations. Levant vACC and its staff are not responsible for any misuse of this policy outside the VATSIM environment.

### Grading Criteria

Controllers will be graded during each session with a mentor or instructor. These evaluations are designed using Competency-Based Training and Assessment (CBTA) principles to ensure that controllers are progressing in both skills and knowledge. These results will be delivered to the student via a scoresheet tailored for the requirements for the VATSIM network.

### Required Reading

Students shall read the following documentation in preparation for the practical training phase.

#### Foundations

The vMATS Documents can be found on the [Arabian vACC's Website](https://library.arabianvacc.com/foundations/) while we start writing our own.

### Training Phases

#### Self-Study
Students are expected to arrive at each session with a solid understanding of the relevant theory.  

- If a student lacks the required pre-requisite knowledge, the session may be concluded early or rescheduled.  
- Being well-prepared allows students to gain the maximum benefit from each session while also ensuring that mentors’ time is used effectively.  

The level of self-study required in this block will be significantly greater than in the previous one. Although the exact time commitment will vary between individuals, students should plan to dedicate approximately an equal amount of time to self-study as to mentoring sessions.  

For example: for every 1.5 hour mentoring session, students should spend around 1.5 hours reviewing material, consolidating knowledge, and preparing for the next session.  

#### Phase 2: Consolidation & Network Practice
During this phase, students will take part in multiple one-to-one mentoring sessions aimed at consolidating the skills developed in Phase 1, with a particular focus on applying them to live network traffic. Mentors will tailor the content of these sessions to the individual student’s strengths and areas for improvement.

For students who actively engage in sessions and maintain consistent self-study, this phase is expected to require 3 to 5 sessions.

#### Solo Validation: Tower
**As students approach the final stage of training, they may be granted a Solo Tower Validation.**  
This is a time-limited endorsement that authorises the student to control independently on the tower position for which they are training.
- Each validation is issued for a maximum of **30 days** from the mentoring session in which it was recommended.  
- Across the entire tower training programme, a student may hold up to **90 days** of solo validation in total.  

#### Self-Study
During this phase, self-study remains highly important.  
By this stage, students are expected to already have a solid understanding of:  

- All theoretical material required for S2 training.  
- The designated **vMATS Part 1 & Part 2** content.  
- The Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for their assigned aerodrome.

Self-study at this point should primarily focus on keeping knowledge current and reviewing any areas of difficulty identified during previous mentoring sessions.

#### Pre-CPT Check
The Pre-CPT check, as outlined in the VATMENA ATC Training Policy, serves as a training checkpoint to assess a student’s readiness before scheduling their practical examination for the relevant rating.  

- The Pre-CPT acts as a **mock practical exam**, allowing students to demonstrate their skills prior to the official evaluation.  
- It should ideally be conducted on the live network, though the Sweatbox server may be used if necessary.  
- The choice of environment should consider traffic levels at the aerodrome at that time.  
- If the student is deemed ready, the mentor or instructor will forward them to the relevant channel for the official examination.
