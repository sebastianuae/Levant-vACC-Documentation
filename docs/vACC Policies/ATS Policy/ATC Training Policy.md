## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This Air Traffic Services (ATS) Policy defines the standards, requirements, and procedures for providing air traffic control and related services by Levant vACC controllers on the VATSIM network. It ensures realistic, safe, and consistent ATS delivery across all positions and sessions within Levant vACC.

### 1.2 Scope

This policy applies to all members controlling or training to control ATS positions in Levant vACC airspace. It governs operational conduct, frequency use, information management, and compliance with VATSIM’s global policies.

### 1.3 Applicability

This document must be read in conjunction with the:

- VATSIM Global Controller Administration Policy (GCAP)
- VATSIM Air Traffic Control Frequency and Information Management Policy
- Levant vACC ATS Policy

### 1.4 Liability

All material in this policy is intended for simulation use only. It must not be applied to real-world aviation operations. Levant vACC and its staff are not responsible for any misuse of this policy outside the VATSIM environment.

## 2. Definitions

**ATS:** Air Traffic Services provided by controllers on the VATSIM network.
**Controller:** A VATSIM member with the appropriate rating (S1 and above) authorized to operate ATS positions.
**Position:** Specific ATC role (e.g., GND, TWR, APP, CTR) designated in Levant vACC airspace.
**Training Controller:** A controller undergoing supervised training under the Levant vACC training system.
**Visitor Controller:** A non-resident controller authorized to operate positions in Levant vACC per visiting rules.

## 3. Foundation for Students

### 3.1 Software

#### 3.2 Controller Client 

EuroScope is the primary radar client used for controlling within the Levant vACC. It can be downloaded from the [Euroscope Website.](https://www.euroscope.hu/wp/) All Levant vACC sector files are specifically designed to work with EuroScope only.

The Operations Department releases updated sector files every AIRAC cycle to ensure controllers have the latest navigation data and any changes relevant to the FIRs.

Sector files for each FIR can be downloaded from the [AeroNav GNG](https://www.aero-nav.com) website, with direct links to each FIR below:

[Baghdad FIR (ORBB)](https://files.aero-nav.com/ORBB)
[Beirut FIR (OLBB)](https://files.aero-nav.com/OLBB)
[Damacus FIR (OSTT)](https://files.aero-nav.com/OSTT)

A detailed setup guide for installing EuroScope and the Levant vACC sector files are available on the Levant vACC YouTube channel.

#### 3.3 Audio Client(s)

To communicate with pilots while controlling on the network, you must install an approved Audio for VATSIM (AFV) client. Supported options include [Audio for VATSIM](https://audio.vatsim.net) and/or [TrackAudio.](https://github.com/pierr3/TrackAudio/releases)

##### 3.4 vATIS Client

To provide pilots with up-to-date aerodrome operational information, you will need [vATIS](https://vatis.app)

The ATS Department releases regular updates to our vATIS profiles to ensure all relevant airport conditions and NOTAMS are simulated and shown on the ATIS. You may download the vATIS Profiles [here](https://vats.im/levatis)

## 4. The Training Queue

Before a controller can be offered a place in a training plan, they must first express their interest and be added to the waiting list.

After completing all prerequisites outlined in the Training Plan section, the controller must submit a support ticket through the Levant vACC Discord to confirm their eligibility.

Controllers will only be enrolled into a training plan once all requirements have been fully met.
