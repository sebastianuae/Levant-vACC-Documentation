## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This Air Traffic Control (ATC) Training Policy defines the standards, requirements, and procedures for providing air traffic control and related services by Levant vACC controllers on the VATSIM network. It ensures realistic, safe, and consistent ATS delivery across all positions and sessions within Levant vACC.

### 1.2 Scope

This policy applies to all members controlling or training to control ATS positions in Levant vACC airspace. It governs operational conduct, frequency use, information management, and compliance with VATSIM’s global policies.

### 1.3 Applicability

This document must be read in conjunction with the:

- VATSIM Global Controller Administration Policy (GCAP)
- VATSIM Air Traffic Control Frequency and Information Management Policy

!!! warning
    All material in this policy is intended for simulation use only. It must not be applied to real-world aviation operations. Levant vACC and its staff are not responsible for any misuse of this policy outside the VATSIM environment.

## 2. Definitions

**ATS:** Air Traffic Services provided by controllers on the VATSIM network.
**Controller:** A VATSIM member with the appropriate rating (S1 and above) authorized to operate ATS positions.
**Position:** Specific ATC role (e.g., GND, TWR, APP, CTR) designated in Levant vACC airspace.
**Resident Controller:** A controller based within the Levant vACC.
**Visitor Controller:** A non-resident controller authorized to operate positions in Levant vACC per visiting rules.

## 3. Foundation for Students

### 3.1 Software

#### 3.1.1 Controller Client 

EuroScope is the primary radar client used for controlling within the Levant vACC. It can be downloaded from the [Euroscope Website.](https://www.euroscope.hu/wp/) All Levant vACC sector files are specifically designed to work with EuroScope only.

The Operations Department releases updated sector files every AIRAC cycle to ensure controllers have the latest navigation data and any changes relevant to the FIRs.

Sector files for each FIR can be downloaded from the [AeroNav GNG](https://www.aero-nav.com) website, with direct links to each FIR below:

[Baghdad FIR (ORBB)](https://files.aero-nav.com/ORBB)
[Beirut FIR (OLBB)](https://files.aero-nav.com/OLBB)
[Damacus FIR (OSTT)](https://files.aero-nav.com/OSTT)

A detailed setup guide for installing EuroScope and the Levant vACC sector files are available on the Levant vACC YouTube channel.

#### 3.1.2 Audio Client(s)

To communicate with pilots while controlling on the network, you must install an approved Audio for VATSIM (AFV) client. Supported options include [Audio for VATSIM](https://audio.vatsim.net) and/or [TrackAudio.](https://github.com/pierr3/TrackAudio/releases)

#### 3.1.3 vATIS Client

To provide pilots with up-to-date aerodrome operational information, you will need [vATIS](https://vatis.app)

The ATS Department releases regular updates to our vATIS profiles to ensure all relevant airport conditions and NOTAMS are simulated and shown on the ATIS. You may download the vATIS Profiles [here](https://vats.im/levatis)

### 3.2 The Training Queue

Before a controller can be offered a place in a training plan, they must first express their interest and be added to the waiting list.

After completing all prerequisites outlined in Section 5, the controller must submit a support ticket through the [Levant vACC Website](https://levantvacc.net) to confirm their eligibility.

Controllers will only be enrolled into a training plan once all requirements have been fully met.

#### 3.2.1 Acceptance Into The Training Queue

To remain on the waiting list, controllers must:

- Remain active on Levant vACC roster
- Maintain residency within the Levant vACC

Controllers who do not meet these conditions will be removed from the waiting list.

#### 3.2.2 Removal from the Training Queue

The Levant vACC ATS Department reserves the right to remove a controller from the waiting list without prior notice in circumstances including, but not limited to:

- Disciplinary action taken against the controller
- Repeated negative feedback received while controlling positions associated with their current rating

### 3.3 Controller Activity

All resident and visiting controllers within the Levant vACC must log a minimum of **3 hours** of ATC activity per calendar quarter to remain active on the controller roster.

Failure to meet this requirement will result in automatic removal from the roster and any associated training plan or waiting list.

The calendar quarters are defined below:

**- Quarter 1 (Q1) - 1 January - 31 March**
**- Quarter 2 (Q2) - 1 April - 30 June**
**- Quarter 3 (Q3) - 1 July - 30 September**
**- Quarter 4 (Q4) - 1 October - 31 December**

## 4. Training Plan

### 4.1 Eligibility 

To be eligible to commence training within the Levant vACC, members must meet the following criteria:

**- Be a resident of the Levant vACC in good standing**
**- Completed divisional exam with an 80% or more**

Controllers wishing to progress beyond the S1 rating must also meet the following criteria:

**- Be active on the Levant vACC roster**
**- Accumulate 50 hours of controlling time under their current rating**
**- Have no more than two instances of negative feedback on their record**

This policy ensures fair and efficient use of training resources and minimizes delays for members in the training queue. This also ensures competency within the training queue to maximize student potential.

### 4.2 Training facilities across the Levant vACC FIRs

**- Aerodrome (S1/S2)**
    - Beirut Rafic Hariri International Airport (OLBA)
**- Terminal (S3)**
    - Beirut Rafic Hariri International Airport (OLBA)
**- Enroute (C1)**
    - Baghdad FIR (ORBB)

### 4.3 Training Engagement and Availability Expectations

ATC Training within the Levant vACC is a lengthy process. Given the high demand for training and the limited amount of mentors available, training resources must be used efficiently. To support this, members enrolled in a training plan are expected to demonstrate consistent engagement and flexibility.

#### 4.3.1 Availability Requirements

**- Maintaining Availability:** Students must keep their availability in the training thread up-to-date at all times while holding a position within a training plan.
**- Active Session Requests:** An active session request in the training thread is required at all times. This allows mentors and instructors to identify and accept training opportunities efficiently.
**- Diverse Availability:** Students should aim to provide a wide range of availability, including daytime, evenings, and weekends where possible. As mentors and instructors may be located in different time zones, flexibility significantly increases the likelihood of receiving training sessions.
**- Session Cancellations:** If a student needs to cancel a scheduled session or withdraw a session request, they must enotify their mentor or instructor via the training thread.

#### 4.3.2 Leave of Absence (LOA)

If a student is unable to participate in training for an extended period while enrolled in a training plan, they must notify the Levant vACC ATS Department by submitting a support ticket via the Levant vACC website. Requests for a break will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. The department will make every effort to accommodate personal circumstances, but clear communication is essential.

#### 4.3.3 Mentor Availability and Expectations

Mentors and instructors are volunteers who generously offer their time. While the department aims to provide each student with approximately 2–3 hours of training per week, this is not always possible. All training staff, including department members, instructors, and mentors, on an ad hoc basis, and availability may vary from week to week. As such, the frequency of training sessions cannot be guaranteed.

#### 4.3.4 Recommendations from the ATS Department to Improve Training Opportunities

To increase the likelyhood of receiving training sessions, students are strongly encouraged to:

**- Enter as much availability as possible for the next 14 days
**- Provide availability in blocks of at least 90 minutes

### 4.4 Training Plan Removal

To ensure fairness to all students awaiting entry into the training plan, spots may be forfeited for reasons under the following conditions:

**- Member becomes inactive on the Levant vACC roster**
**- Member fails to provide availability within one week of receiving a reminder**
**- Member fails to attend two scheduled mentoring sessions (AKA no-shows)**

#### 4.4.1 Discretionary Removal

The ATS Director reserves the right to remove a member from a training plan at their discretion in circumstances including, but not limited to:

**- Consistent lack of progress compared to expected training milestonoes**
**- Lack of engagement with the course or training staff**
**- Disciplinary acation against the member**
**- Repeated negative feedback while controlling positions the member is rated for**

## 5. Self Study

Students are expected to engage with the theoretical content provided in the [Levant vACC Documentation](https://levantvacc.net/documentation) outside of their scheduled mentoring sessions. This includes, but is not limited to, reviewing assigned readings, practicing relevant skills, and deepening their understanding of core concepts. Mentors and instructors may also suggest additional resources or encourage observation of experienced controllers.

After each mentoring session, mentors and instructors will provide comprehensive feedback in a scoresheet. It is the student's responsibility to carefully review these reports and address any areas highlighted by the mentor for improvement. This may involve independent study on certain topics or revisiting specific techniques. Research consistently shows that students who actively engage with feedback and make necessary adjustments tend to progress more rapidly through training and perform better on exams.

Arriving unprepared for a session, whether through a lack of review of session reports or theoretical material, is considered unprofessional. Mentors and instructors are within their rights to end a session prematurely if they feel that the student has not made adequate efforts to prepare. In such cases, a report will be submitted to the ATS Director for further review. This may lead to the student's removal from the training plan if insufficient progress or engagement is noted.

## 6. Asking for Help

In aviation, there are no "stupid" questions. It is always better to ask than to remain silent. The ATC Training Department staff, instructors, and mentors are always available and happy to assist students with any questions related to their training. Students are encouraged to direct their questions to their training thread.


## 7. Attending a Mentoring Session

Mentoring sessions will be conducted via the Discord, which offers the ability to use screen-sharing when necessary. Students should join the waiting room promptly, fully prepared with their controlling software configured and any necessary resources at hand, ready to begin the session as soon as their mentor or instructor moves them into the training room.

!!! info
    Due to local regulations in the countries, where VOIP services like Discord are blocked, students residing in these places will not be able to conduct their sessions through Discord. In such cases, an alternative communication platform may be used, subject to agreement between the student and their mentor or instructor. While it is possible to use a VPN to bypass these restrictions, the Levant vACC does not support or endorse the use of VPNs to work around these restrictions.

## 8. Solo Validations

In accordance with the Middle East & North Africa Division ATC Training Policy, the Levant vACC is responsible for issuing solo validations for students working toward their tower, approach, and center ratings. The responsibility for these validations lies with the assigned mentor or instructor. The following solo validations may be granted:

| Solo Validation | Details |
| --------------- | ------- |
| **Tower**       | - Available for students training for S2.
                    - Granted for the position where the student's training has taken place.
                    - Valid for up to 90 days. |
| **Approach**    | - Availability for students training for S3.
                    - Granted for the position where the student's training has taken place.
                    - Valid for up to 90 days. |
| **Center**      | - Available for students training for C1.
                    - Granted for the position where the student's training has taken place.
                    - Valid for up to 90 days. |

Solo validations will only be granted for a maximum of 30 days at a time before a practical exam is required. If a student does not pass the exam, they may continue to operate under a solo validation after receiving additional mentoring sessions. Students holding a solo validation are authorized to control at any time on their assigned training position, including during events, without the presence of a mentor.

## 9. Examinations

### 9.1 Theoretical

All theoretical modules and exams for the S1, S2, S3, and C1 ratings are available through the [Divisional Website](https://exams.vatsim.me). Completion of these modules and exams is required to be eligible for enrollment in a training plan.

### 9.2 Practical

When a student, in agreement with their mentor or instructor, feels ready, they can submit a request for an examination through the ATC Training Department. Before being forwarded for a practical exam, students will be consulted to ensure they are fully prepared, and additional training can be arranged if requested by the student.

For S2 exams, there will be one local examiner present. S3 and C1 exams will have both a divisional examiner and a local examiner in attendance.

All exams are open-book. Students are encouraged to use any available resources to assist in answering questions. Examiners prefer that students know where to find information rather than guess. However, students are prohibited from soliciting answers from others on the network. Any attempt to do so will result in an automatic failure of the exam.

Exams typically last no more than 90 minutes, followed by a debrief with the examiners to ensure the exam process is concluded.

The possible outcomes of the exam are as follows:

- Pass
- Incomplete (to be continued at a later date)
- Fail

An exam will not be marked as a pass if:

- Any competency is marked as fail.
- Three or more competencies are marked as inadequate.

If the student passes the exam, a rating request will be sent, and the rating will be issued within 48 hours after the exam report has been submitted. If the exam is marked as incomplete, exam will be continued at a later date.

In the event of a failure, the examiners will conduct a thorough debrief and create a remedial training plan, which will be forwarded to the student's mentor or instructor.

## 10. Fast Track Program

In accordance with the Middle East & North Africa Division ATC Training Policy, the Levant vACC offers a fast-track program for members who hold real-world ATC licenses or wish to transfer their rating from IVAO. To begin this process, members must submit a support ticket on the Levant vACC Website, with their license displayed on VATSIM, or their IVAO profile.

All members participating in the fast-track program are still required to complete the relevant theoretical exams for the rating they are pursuing. Upon successfully passing these exams, they will proceed with the standard mentoring sessions before being issued their rating.

### 10.1 Real World Licenses

| Real-World License Fast Track | Rating |
| ----------------------------- | ------ |
| Frozen ATPL, ATPL, MPL, and Real-World ATCO up to TWR | S2 |
| All Real-World ATCO | S3 |

### 10.2 IVAO Rating Transfer

| IVAO Fast Track | Rating |
| --------------- | ------ |
| ADC and Below | No Fast Track Possible |
| APC | S2 |
